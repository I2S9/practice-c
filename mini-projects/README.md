# Mini Projects

This repository contains several mini projects. 

These are not difficult or complicated projects, I realize them in order to practice coding. They may contain errors, use the code at your own risk.

## Plan 
### I. School Management System

The goal of this project is to manipulate data structures and create a school management project by the entrance of the user. By running this program, you can create some students, courses, grades and so one. 

### II. The Right Price

<p align="justify">
This project aims to rebuild the famous game "the right price" via a simulation on the Terminal. The goal is to guess which number was randomly generated by the machine (or program) and depending on your answer, the program will tell you if the number generated is larger or smaller. One of the possible improvements would be to introduce a more attractive graphical interface that further promotes the user experience.

### III. Password Generator

<p align="justify">
Nowadays, when many people are wondering about the reliability and confidentiality of password managers, I wondered if they were really reliable. Among the least secure, we can mention Chrome which has received many warnings from Google. Until 2013, it did not store passwords in a database but locally on our PC. Moreover, the system was not based on hashing (in short, it is a more secure way to encrypt passwords so that, even when you come across the file, you are not able to find them). Already anyone who had access to this file accidentally came face to face with all our passwords but in addition, it was accessible via commands in the terminal.

I personally use Firefox, one of the most recommended browsers for security (we can also add Brave). Using this password management system regularly, I then tested their reliability via NordPass :

</p>

<p align="justify">
We can see that the password is robust, and this is what is desired given the number of pishing attacks, trojan, brute force or other malware. But what if a big data breach were to come.. new scandals emerge every year and our personal data is not safe.

Although other password generation services are deployed, sometimes even at expensive prices, it is better to own your own password generator. So in this project, I will create a program in C language creating a file generating a randomly robust password that will then be encrypted with a complex hash function (possible improvements).

Recommendations : Most people do not bind their password manager. It is advisable to bind them directly after use. Use two-factor authentication for each account as well as for your password manager. Generally, never let your browser save your passwords. Always use passwords that are randomly generated by your password manager. For Chromebook users, it is advisable to enable Linux and install a password manager.

#### Understand the generation of a strong password : 

<p align="justify">
Thanks to the site FranceNum.gouv, we notice that the length and variation of the characters is important: a password of 6 characters, although they are varied can be guessed immediately (using the "unfortunate" means mentioned above) and a rather long password (11 characters) composed only of lowercase or numbers is found instantly or in about thirty minutes. 

<p align="center">

</p>

On the other hand, by combining some of the two methods, finding an 11-character password (numbers, uppercase, lowercase and special characters) can be found within almost three years. And it becomes much more interesting when you exceed 12 characters (226 years to password) and nearly 26 trillion years for 18 characters.

As I like the challenge, we will generate the strongest passwords avce 18 characters all as varied as each other.
